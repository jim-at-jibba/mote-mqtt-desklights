# Pimoroni Mote lights controller with MQTT

You will need to install:

- (Motephat)[https://github.com/pimoroni/mote-phat] or (Mote)[https://github.com/pimoroni/mote] python library
- the (paho-mqtt)[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1]

You will also need an MQTT broker running. This is can be a public broker or one running locally. You likely need to change the broker address, port and topic.

This is the first python script I have written so it might be shit!
